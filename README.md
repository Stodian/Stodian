### ðŸ‘‹ Hola!

....

I'm Ethan, an Electrical Design Engineer with a fear of code. 

By day, I'm focused on designing electrical systems for buildings, and by night, learning to replace myself with AI.


## **Goal:** ##
**Using C# & Python to Design a complete, clash free... MEP (Mech, Elec & Plumb) system with a single .rvt file input.**

....


To retirement,  
Ethan
